# CookAI: AI-Powered Cooking Companion
## Written Proposal

---

### The Problem

Home cooking is broken. 40% of food purchased in the US is wasted ($408B annually). Meal planning takes hours. Recipe apps are static databases that don't adapt. And when you're actually cooking, you're left juggling a phone with flour-covered hands.

Existing recipe apps solve one problem each: Yummly does discovery, Paprika does organization, Mela does saving. None combines AI intelligence with the full cooking lifecycle - from "what's in my fridge?" to "dinner is served."

The result: people default to takeout ($1.1T US food delivery market), food rots in fridges, and cooking feels like a chore instead of a joy.

### Target Audience

**Primary: Millennials & Gen Z home cooks (22-40)**
- Cook 3-5 times per week but want to cook more
- Tech-savvy, comfortable with AI tools
- Budget-conscious but willing to pay for convenience
- Care about food waste and sustainability

**Secondary: Busy parents**
- Need weekly meal planning that actually works
- Want quick recipes using what they already have
- Value hands-free cooking assistance

**Market Size:** 128M US households that cook at home. Recipe app market valued at $1.2B (2025) growing at 12.4% CAGR.

### The Solution: CookAI

CookAI is the first AI cooking platform that covers the entire cooking journey:

1. **Discover** - Snap a photo of your fridge; AI identifies ingredients and generates personalized recipes
2. **Plan** - AI builds a balanced weekly meal plan from your recipe collection, optimizing for nutrition, variety, and your taste profile
3. **Cook** - Hands-free voice-guided cooking with step-by-step narration, auto-detected timers, and an AI sous chef for real-time questions
4. **Save** - Anti-Waste Engine transforms leftovers into creative meals, tracking money saved

The AI Taste Profile learns from every interaction - what cuisines you prefer, spice tolerance, dietary patterns - making every suggestion smarter over time.
